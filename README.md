Remote PPG Development for Rice RET 2019

Abstract: The pulse is an important vital sign that gives the medical state of a person. 
Access to affordable and reliable ways to measure vital signs is a struggle for many 
underserved communities. One solution is to create methods of measuring a pulse, or 
photoplethysmogram (ppg), using a camera from an existing device, like a smartphone or 
laptop. In this way, patients can connect to care-givers using telemedicine and their 
currently available devices. Telemedicine means patients can have remote access to 
care-givers in a more flexible way than traditional treatment pathways. Many devices 
exist for obtaining a ppg such as a pulse oximeter, but these devices require contact 
with the patient and are not easily integrated into telemedicine systems. The remote ppg 
technique allows for real-time analysis of the pulse using only a webcam. The remote ppg 
algorithm implemented here uses a user-selectable region of interest (roi) for which an 
intensity time-series is obtained. This project demonstrates a graphical user interface 
running on a computer for obtaining, analyzing, and visualizing the ppg waveform in 
real-time. Live signals of the remote ppg and a traditional pulse sensor are compared 
for ground truth analysis. The OpenCV and PyQtGraph packages in Python were used to 
create a relatively simple and robust way to obtain, analyze, and visualize the ppg in 
an engaging and accessible format which could be run locally or remotely. Future work 
would have the algorithm track the roi as the person moves in the frame. 

This code is not approved for medical use and should be considered for research purposes only.
